\section{Background}

Currently, I work at Acutec Precision Aerospace which is a company that specializes in CNC Machining and Tooling to make specific parts for airplane breaks. The company is split up in different departments that include engineering, tooling, machining, inspection, and shipping. The engineering department is in charge of making setup sheets for the toolroom that includes providing all the tools that need to be used for a machine and also make blueprints on how to make each specific part for the machines. The tooling department is in charge of building tools on the setup sheets, tearing down the tool, and sorting the tools away in its correct place. The machining department makes the part using the correct tools and following the blueprint. The inspection department is in charge of checking for any mistakes. Finally, the shipping department is in charge of sending the parts to the customer. Now you know how the company works you will have to gain some knowledge on the Application WINTOOL and Tooling to understand the problem I am trying to solve.

\subsection{Tooling Materials}

Tools that are built for the machines includes spot drills, core drills, end mills, ball-end mills, taps, face mills, and inserts. Typically you would put those tool into a toolholder.The different tool holders come in a 40 taper and a 50 taper variation. That just means one is bigger than the other. The different types of machines that are used at Acutec include 5-axis and horizontal that uses 50 taper holders and Vertical machines that use the smaller 40 taper holders. Also to note each tool holder needs a special knob that could either be a Mazak knob or Mori knob. The knobs are used to make sure no fluids get in the tool because it could loosen the tool in the machine. The knob that is chosen depends on the machine that is being used for each specific tool.

\section{Problem}

The WINTOOL application dismissed one of the dilemmas but created another dilemma. The new problem that was created involves data entry. The reason there is a data entry problem is that you need to find and type in all the dimensions of each tool, but because the old setup sheets don't give EDP numbers you have to search through different catalogs to find the tools information.  You have to individually type all that information in the WINTOOL database. That's a huge problem because the company has over fifteen thousand different tools so that will take forever to individually type every tool in the WINTOOL system. Currently, the company has typed in around one thousand tools so far but took over a year to complete that task. At this current pace, it will take around 15 years just to achieve the data entry aspect of the project.


\section{Motivation}

The tool search engine application I am planning to make interests me because it would save me a lot of time at work. Once I overtook the WINTOOL project I realized how long this project might take to complete. This is the first big project that I got put in charge of in the company and I want to make sure I make a very good impression. The idea of making search engines excites me because it allows me to learn something new. Also at the same time, it saves me a lot of work and the company a lot of money. Nothing motivates me more in life than having the chance to improve my ability to think and expand my horizons.
